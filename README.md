# Octopus Authentication Node

Octopus Authentication is a high-assurance, passwordless authentication
system engineered to address the diverse authentication needs of a
real-world, working enterprise. The Secret Double Octopus solution
replaces all employee passwords with a strong, password-free
authentication mechanism.

Octopus Authentication Node enhances Forgerock’s authentication
capabilities by allowing users to authenticate using the Octopus
Authenticator mobile app. The authentication flow is presented in the
diagram below.

Octopus Authentication Node can be easily downloaded directly from
ForgeRock Marketplace.

**ForgeRock Authentication with Octopus Authentication Node**

## Prerequisites

Before beginning installation, verify that the following requirements
have been met:

  - Octopus Authentication Server v4.6 (or higher) is installed and
    operating with a valid enterprise certificate (for User Portal and
    administrator access via HTTPS)

  - Users are enrolled on the Octopus Authenticator mobile app

  - ForgeRock is installed and operating

  - Octopus Authentication Node has been downloaded from ForgeRock
    Marketplace
  - The **gson.jar** file has been downloaded from Google     

## <a name="architecture"></a>System Architecture Overview

The high-level architecture of the Octopus Authentication Node and
ForgeRock integration is shown in the diagram below. The numbers in the
diagram represent the authentication flow:

1.  The user sends a login request to the ForgeRock portal.

2.  The request goes to the ForgeRock server, which operates Octopus
    Authentication Node.

3.  Octopus Authentication Node sends a REST API call to the Octopus
    Server.

4.  The user is authenticated with Octopus Authenticator.

Flow**

# Configuring the Octopus Management Console

Before installation and configuring Octopus Authentication Node, you
need to make the following preparations in the Octopus Management
Console:

  - Integrating Your Corporate Directory

  - [Creating the REST API Service](#service)

## Integrating Your Corporate Directory

Follow the steps below to integrate your corporate directory with
the Octopus Management Console.

You can integrate either an **Active Directory** type or a **ForgeRock directory** type.

**To integrate your corporate Directory:**

1.  From the Octopus Management Console, open the **System Settings**
    menu and select **Directories**.
5.  Click **Add Directory** to open the **Select Directory Type**
    dialog. From the **Directory Type** dropdown list, select either **Active Directory** or **ForgeRock**.
    
    ![](.//media/DirectoryType_1.png)

2.  If you want directory users to be synced automatically, enable the **Directory Sync** toggle button. When Directory Sync is disabled     (as in the example below) you will need to import users manually. (For more information, refer to the Octopus Management Console    Admin Guide.)

    ![](.//media/DirectoryType_2.png)

6.  Click **Select**.

    The **New Directory** page opens.

7.  Configure the following parameters, based on your corporate Directory settings:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Value / Notes</strong></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Corporate Directory Server name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Base DN</td>
    <td>Directory Distinguished Name; Directory top tree level, from where a server will search for users<br />
    (e.g., dc=&lt;AD name&gt;,dc=com)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>User DN</td>
    <td>Directory Administrator User DN string (e.g., cn=administrator=users, dc=&lt;AD name&gt;,dc=com)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Password</td>
    <td>Directory Administrator Principal’s password</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Host Name/URL</td>
    <td>Corporate Directory URL (LDAP/LDAPS) and port</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Upload Certificate</td>
    <td>Directory LDAPS 64-base encoded root CA. If you are using LDAPS, click and upload the certificate file.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

8.  To verify your settings, click **Test Connection**.

9.  At the bottom of the page, click **Save**.

10. Open the directory’s **Policy** tab. In the **Authenticators**
    section, verify that the **Octopus Authenticator** toggle button is
    enabled.

11. Click **Save** (if the **Save** button is enabled) and then publish
    your changes.

## <a name="service"></a>Creating the REST API Service

Follow the steps below to create the required REST API service and
configure its settings.

**To add and configure the REST API service:**
1.  From the Octopus Management Console, open the **Services** menu and click **Add Service**.

1. In the **REST API** tile, click **Add**.

    ![](.//media/image6.png)

    Then, in the dialog that opens, click **Create**.

    ![](.//media/image7.png)

1. Open the **Parameters** tab. From the **Octopus Authentication
    Login** dropdown list, select the credential type that will be sent
    by the user for the authentication (usually **Email**).

    ![](.//media/image9.png)

    Then, click **Save**.
    
1.  If you have integrated a **ForgeRock** directory type, and you want to use a ForgeRock-specific identifier for user authentication,    follow these steps to override the Octopus Authentication Login parameter selected in Step 4:

    a. At the top of the **Parameters** tab, open the **Service Parameters** list and select the relevant directory. For example:
    
     ![](.//media/ServiceParameters_FR.png)
    
    **Note**: If the directory is disabled, enable it by opening the **Directories** tab, selecting the directory and clicking **Save**.
  
    b. Select the checkbox next to the **Octopus Authentication Login** parameter. Then, open the dropdown list and select the value to   override the default parameter.
    
    ![](.//media/OverrideParameter_FRDirectory.png)
    
    c. At the bottom of the **Parameters** tab, click **Save**.

1. Open the **Sign On** tab and review the following settings:

    | ------------------------------ |  ------------------------------   |
    | Authentication Token Timeout   | Used as part of the REST API communication. It sets the token timeout for an authentication request from the application.                            |
    | Rest Payload Signing Algorithm | Method with which the X.509 certificate was generated.                                                                                               |

# Installing and Configuring Octopus Authentication Node

Octopus Authentication Node enables authentication to ForgeRock using
Octopus Authenticator. When the node is added to your realm flow,
authentication requests are sent to the Octopus Authentication Server,
and users then approve the authentication on the Octopus Authenticator
Mobile App (see [System Architecture](#architecture) diagram).

**IMPORTANT**: In order to successfully work with Octopus Authentication
Node, the Octopus Authentication Server needs to be installed and
operational, and the relevant users need to be enrolled with the Octopus
Authenticator Mobile App.

**To install Octopus Authentication Node:**
1.  Download the latest version of the SDO integration (**octopusNode-1.0.0.jar**) from ForgeRock MarketPlace.

1.  Copy the .jar file into the **../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib** directory where your AM console is deployed.

2.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.

    After the restart, the node will appear in the Authentication Trees **Components** palette.

3.  Add Octopus Authentication Node to your environment. For example:

    ![](.//media/image13.png)

4.  Continue by configuring node parameters, as described below.

## Configuring Octopus Authentication Node

The final step of the integration process is configuring the parameters
for Octopus Authentication Node.

![](.//media/image14.png)

The values for the **Service Key**, **Service URL** and **Service
Certificate** can be copied from the **Sign On** tab of the REST API
service that you created in the Octopus Management Console:

 - **REST Endpoint URL:** Click the Copy icon to copy the value.

 - **X.509 Certificate and Service Key:** Click **View**. Then, in the
    popup that opens, click **Copy** to copy the value.
